## Concept:
It's Cold - A (narrative) personal project by Sam Scott
* This game is about someone just trying to get inside. It's cold out, you know?
* The player can walk around the world. They can talk, they can receive items
* The world is built up with places/people to interact
* Small gameplay experience. 10-20 minutes average playtime is the goal
